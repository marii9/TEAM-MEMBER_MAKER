## Description

This application is an organizational tool for creating and managing a team of employees in a company. The application allows users to create employee profiles for each team member, including their name, ID, email, role, and specific details for each role (such as office number for managers, GitHub username for engineers, and school for interns). The application is built using JavaScript, and utilizes class-based inheritance to define the properties and methods specific to each employee role. The application also includes unit tests to ensure the functionality of the employee classes.
